Flappy bird is a part of CS50's game development course
I've implemented different concepts that would make the game more fun like sound effects, trophies etc
Once you hit a certain score, trophies (bronze, silver, and gold are displayed)
It contains a pause state, randomisation of gaps between the pipes and time intervals at which the pipes spawn. 
'Tab' key allows you to pause the game.
